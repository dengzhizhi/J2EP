<h1>Install</h1>

<h2>Pre install notes</h2>
<p>
	This site has some pages that are shown incorrectly with 
	Internet Explorer 6.0. That is a problem with your browser,
	not with this page.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
	To run J2EP you need an application server implementing the J2EE
	servlet specification of version 2.3 or later. You will need J2SE 
	1.4 or later to run J2EP.
</p>

<p>
	J2EP depends on some external libraries. The libraries needed are 
	all licensed under the same license as J2EP (Apache 2.0) and are 
	included in the release. The libraries are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">commons-httpclient</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/">commons-digester</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec/">commons-codec</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/">commons-beanutils</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">commons-logging</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>
	The following installation instructions are assuming you are
	running <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat 5.5
	</a>. If you aren't, consult your container's manual for 
	instructions on how to deploy a WAR.
</p>

<p>
	Installing the proxy is rather easy, all you have to to is 
	extract the	
	WAR from the release and deploy it to your 
	container. For tomcat this is done from the manager, located at 
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/manager/html">
	http://localhost:8080/manager/html</a> at default. In the 
	manager look up "WAR file to deploy" and in the "file input" locate 
	the WAR included with this release. Now, simple press "Deploy".
</p>

<h2>Run in ROOT context</h2>
<p>
	After you have deployed the webapp a good thing to do is change 
	the name for your new directory to make sure that the proxy is 
	running in the root. This isn't necessary and the proxy will 
	work under any context but you usually want the proxy to handle 
	all requests to the server.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	Go to your tomcat installation directory and browse to 
	TOMCAT_ROOT/webapps/ here you should find a directory named 
	j2ep-VERSION. 
</li>
<li>
	Simply rename this directory to ROOT (making sure to backup any
	existing directories and files). 
</li>
<li>
	Tomcat will probably notice that you have changed the webapp 
	folder and reload the files for you, otherwise you will have to
	restart Tomcat.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Test that it works</h2>

<p>
	Make sure you have deployed the proxy with the default configuration
	file before continuing. The following text also assumes that you are
	running the proxy in the ROOT context, otherwise you have to add the
	context to the links.
</p>

<p>
	Try connection to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>, or the URL where
	you are running your server and have deployed the proxy to. Going to this page should let you see
	the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">http://jakarta.apache.org</a> web page.

</p>

<p>
	Try to go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/news/">http://localhost:8080/news/</a>
	instead. This is a mapping of the www.nytimes.com page as found in the 
	<a href="configuration.html">configuration</a>.
	Compare the page to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">www.nytimes.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
	In fact there is a difference between the two pages. This is a problem with 
	link rewriting which you can read about in the 
	<a href="rewrite.html">rewrite manual</a>.
